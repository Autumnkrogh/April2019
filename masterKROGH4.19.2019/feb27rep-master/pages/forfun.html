  <h1>About the Artist</h1>
    
    <div class="wrapper">
        <div><p>Autumn Krogh-Bushnell is a self-taught watercolor artist who was born and raised in Utah. Throughout childhood, she frequented trips to visit her grandfather, a professional artist and potter. He went on to earn his Bachelor's degree in English Language from Weber State University. Soon after, she secured a job as an adjunct lecturer at Dicle University, deep in the Southeast of Turkey. During several years of living amongst political unrest and war, Autumn  found solace in watercolor painting. After the coup attempt in 2016 and aftermath, she had no choice but to leave her position and returned home. 
            </p>
            
            After some time spent back in the Salt Lake Valley, the open road was calling again. This time in a volunteered position for Peace Corps Response in the East of Rwanda.  Attracted  by the culture and attitude of the local village, Kibungo, Autumn began to explore painting again, using her portable Winsor Watercolor travel kit. "When you are isolated in an utterly different culture and space, it's hard not to take all of that in and see the beauty in both the differences and sameness of people. For me, being outside and capturing the daily life of the village, mood, and atmosphere on paper to later share with my friends and family back home, who don't have the opportunity to travel to such places, is just an incredible feeling."
